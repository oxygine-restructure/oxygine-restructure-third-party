How to build and run Oxygine on Windows with CMake and Visual Studio (tested with VS2010). Steps:
=================================================================================================
- build SDL2
- copy SDL2.lib and sdl2main.lib to oxygine-framework/libs

- goto examples/Demo
- create folder "build"
- generate solution with cmake (from oxygine-framework/examples/demo/build folder):
  cmake .. -G"Visual Studio 10"
- open solution. select project Demo and set it "as startup project"
- set working directory for Demo project to: 
   oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\data\
- copy all required dlls to this folder
   oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\data\
   it is SDL2.dll and dlls from  oxygine-framework\oxygine\third_party\win32\libraries\
- ready! run!
=================================================================================================


Also there is prebuilt solution for VS2010 with Test example:
=================================================================================================
open it from oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\win32\
if you don't have directx sdk installed then find open SDL_config_windows.h and comment it:
//#define SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER_XAUDIO2    1
 don't forget copy dlls and set correct working dir (see instruction above)
=================================================================================================
